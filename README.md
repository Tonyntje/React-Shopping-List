# React-Shopping-List

## A new React Project: where to start?
The following is a guideline on how to get started with this new React project. 

### The main points to keep in mind are:
- Consider – what exactly is asked in the assignment? What does it take?
- What data should I store (structure of state)
- Which components should I built
- Which components am I going to make "smart": manage the functions and state
- What stupid components will hang underneath: receive props and visualize what you want to show

### Drawing – draw the framework/skeleton of all the above points
Also, think about the structure and files of the different parts (don't forget that an appropriate and good name is worth gold!)

### Start a new React project
Start your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to start your new project

- $npx create-react-app*PROJECTNAME*
- $cd in your project folder and type $code .
- VS Code with your project is launched

### "Clean" your React project on:
- delete the default JSX and the logo (+ import of this) in App.js
- delete the logo.svg file
- From App.js you will build all components slowly
